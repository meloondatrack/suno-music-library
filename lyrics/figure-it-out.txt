[Verse 1]
Twenty-something with a dead-end plan
Smoking on the roof again
Momma calls, I let it ring
Too broke to feel a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
They say I gotta get it together
But I don't even know what "it" is

[Chorus]
I'll figure it out
Probably not today
I'll figure it out
In my own fucked up way
Everyone's got answers
I just got questions and debt
I'll figure it out
Just not yet

[Verse 2]
Job application, left on read
Same four walls inside my head
Friends are buying homes and shit
I can barely pay for this

[Chorus]
I'll figure it out
Probably not today
I'll figure it out
In my own fucked up way
Everyone's got answers
I just got questions and debt
I'll figure it out
Just not yet

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm a late bloomer
Maybe I'm just a loser
Either way I'm still here
Wasting another year

[Outro]
Figure it out... yeah, yeah...
Just not yet...
