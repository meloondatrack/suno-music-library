[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Clock on the wall doesn't care at all
Counting down the hours since you stopped my call
Laying on the floor staring at the light
Everything is numb but I swear I'm fine

Cigarette burns on the kitchen chair
Your perfume still hanging in the air
Told myself I wouldn't think of you
But the seconds drag and there's nothing else to do

[Chorus]
Tick tock goes the night
Falling through the dark without a fight
I don't feel a thing and that's the worst
Living like I'm stuck inside a hearse
Tick tock let it fade
Nothing left of us but the mess we made

[Verse 2]
Phone screen glowing three AM again
Typing out your name then deleting it
Shadows on the ceiling making shapes
Looking like the future that we didn't take

Maybe I'm addicted to the ache
Holding onto pieces that are bound to break
Every minute feels like pouring rain
Washing me away but I still remain

[Bridge]
I could let you go
I could let you go
But the clock keeps spinning
And I'm just sitting here pretending

[Chorus]
Tick tock goes the night
Falling through the dark without a fight
I don't feel a thing and that's the worst
Living like I'm stuck inside a hearse
Tick tock let it fade
Nothing left of us but the mess we made

[Outro]
[Whispered]
Tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock
