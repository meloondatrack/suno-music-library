## Lyrics
```
[Verse 1]
I rehearse it in the mirror every night
Got the words all lined up right
But when you're standing there
They dissolve into the air
And I'm just smiling like I'm fine

[Chorus]
These words I swallow
They're getting hard to hold
Sitting in my chest
Like secrets getting old
I wanna tell you
But my voice just won't obey
So I keep it in tomorrow
And tomorrow fades away

[Verse 2]
You're laughing at something I said
Meanwhile there's chaos in my head
If you could read between my lines
You'd see me breaking every time
But I just pour another drink instead

[Chorus]
These words I swallow
They're getting hard to hold
Sitting in my chest
Like secrets getting old
I wanna tell you
But my voice just won't obey
So I keep it in tomorrow
And tomorrow fades away

[Bridge]
Maybe silence is my language now
Loving you the only way I know how

[Outro]
Words I swallow... words I swallow...
```
