## Lyrics

[Intro]
What? Yeah
Slatt, slatt
We outside (what?)

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the coupe, yeah (skrrt)
Diamonds on me, they blue, yeah (ice)
She wanna be boo, yeah (what?)
I don't know you, yeah (nah)

[Chorus]
I'm in the sky, yeah, I'm so high, yeah (high)
Countin' up the racks, yeah, don't ask why, yeah (racks)
I'm in the sky, yeah, I'm so high, yeah (what?)
Stars in my eyes, yeah, I don't cry, yeah (slatt)

[Verse 2]
Vampire life, yeah (vamp)
Up all night, yeah (yeah)
She think I'm nice, yeah (what?)
But I'm not right, yeah (slatt)

[Chorus]
I'm in the sky, yeah, I'm so high, yeah (high)
Countin' up the racks, yeah, don't ask why, yeah (racks)
I'm in the sky, yeah, I'm so high, yeah (what?)
Stars in my eyes, yeah, I don't cry, yeah

[Bridge]
What? What? What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Slatt, slatt, slatt

In the sky... (what?)
So high... (yeah)
In the sky...
