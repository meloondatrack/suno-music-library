## Lyrics
```
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Straight up...

[Verse 1]
Late night visions, I've been losin' my mind
Rollin' through the city with the stars aligned
Smoky room, neon glow on my face
Floatin' through dimensions, outer space

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't feel nothin', yeah I'm way too high
Watchin' life pass by, wonderin' why

[Chorus]
You know what it is when I slide through (slide through)
Nighttime callin', what I ride to (ride to)
Lost up in the sauce, yeah I might lose
But I keep on goin', that's the right move

[Verse 2]
Four AM, still ain't slept in days
Money on my mind, got me stuck in a maze
Demons in my head, angels on my back
Balancin' the light with the pitch black

[Chorus]
You know what it is when I slide through (slide through)
Nighttime callin', what I ride to (ride to)
Lost up in the sauce, yeah I might lose
But I keep on goin', that's the right move

[Bridge]
Yeah... (woah)
Floatin'... (it's lit)
Can't stop now...

[Outro]
Slide through... slide through...
You know... you know...
```
